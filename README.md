Please refer to [the official CDK construct](https://github.com/sniptt-official/ots-aws) for detailed instructions.

Grab your API Gateway URL, API key and configure `~/.ots.yaml` (or whatever you provide to `--config`):

```yaml
apiUrl: https://YOUR_API_ID.execute-api.YOUR_REGION.amazonaws.com/prod/secrets
apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY
```

Use `ots` as before:

```
> ots new -x 2h
Using config file: /Users/xxx/.ots.yaml
Enter your secret: ***
Your secret is now available on the below URL.

https://my-ots-web-view.com/burn-secret?id=xxx&ref=ots-cli&region=us-east-1&v=debug#xxx

You should only share this URL with the intended recipient.

Please note that once retrieved, the secret will no longer
be available for viewing. If not viewed, the secret will
automatically expire at approximately xx xxx xxxx xx:xx:xx.
